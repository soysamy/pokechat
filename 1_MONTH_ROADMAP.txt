# 1-Month Roadmap for PokeChat Improvements

## Week 1: UI & Style Enhancements
- Audit all screens for visual consistency (colors, spacing, typography)
- Refine the theme and style files for easier customization
- Improve button, input, and chat bubble styles for a more modern look
- Add light/dark mode toggle and test across devices

## Week 2: UX Improvements
- Streamline onboarding/login flow for new users
- Add helpful error messages and loading indicators throughout the app
- Polish chat interactions (auto-scroll, better input focus, smoother animations)
- Improve accessibility (contrast, font sizes, screen reader support)

## Week 3: Security & Credentials
- Move all API keys and sensitive config to secure storage (e.g., Expo SecureStore)
- Audit codebase to ensure no secrets are hardcoded or exposed
- Add .env support and update documentation for local development
- Implement basic rate limiting and abuse prevention on API calls

## Week 4: Biometric Authentication & Final Polish
- Integrate biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID) for login and/or sensitive actions
- Add settings screen to manage security preferences
- Test biometric flows on both iOS and Android
- Final bug bash and UI/UX polish based on user feedback
